# Tic Tac Toe

I built Tic Tac Toe right before I started learning Backbone.js. I designed it to be similar to Backbone.js in that I created a Board object which is like my Model, and then a BoardView Object that handles drawing out the board and binding the events. This was also practice in TDD with Mocha.

I used Javascript, JQuery, Grunt, Browserify, Sass, Underscore.js, and Mocha to build this app.
